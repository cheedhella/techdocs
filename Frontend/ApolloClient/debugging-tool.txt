GraphQL debugging tools for Apollo Client.
Apollo Client Devtools is a Chrome extension for the open-source GraphQL client, Apollo Client. This extension has 4 main features:

1. A built-in version of the Apollo Studio Explorer that allows you to make queries against your GraphQL server using your app's network interface directly (no configuration necessary).

2. A query watcher that shows you which queries are being watched by the current page, when those queries are loading, and what variables those queries are using.

3. A mutation inspector that displays the mutations made to your Apollo Client application data.

4. A cache inspector that displays your Apollo Client cache data. You can explore the cache through a tree-like interface, and search for specific field keys and values.
