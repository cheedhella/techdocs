What is Z-Index?
    It is used to define stacking order for overlapping elements in a Page;
    Elements with a z-index of 3 is stacked on top of elements with z-index 1 and 2;
    By default, z-index is 0 for all elements and element that appears after another element in the HTML source is stacked above it;
    Layers below 0 are hidden beneath the body, the don't show up at all;
    
    It can be applied to absolute OR relative positioned elements only;
    Static positioned elements always appear below the absolute or relative positioned elements;
    If you have a static positioned element, but you want to control it's stacking layer, assign it relative position 
    without specifying offset; That way, it will appear on the page normally but you will be able to apply z-index to it;
