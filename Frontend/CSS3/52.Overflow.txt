What is Overflow Property?
    If you don't specify height and width for block elements such as <h1>, <div>, <p> etc, they expand to fill the space 
    available to them horizontally and expand vertically in the shrink-to-fit fashion, that is, only enough to accommodate 
    the content contained within them.

    In other words, 
    If you don't define the width of an element, then it is determined by the width of it's parent;
    If it doesn't have any parent, it assumes 100% width of the browser;
    If you don't define the height of an element, then it will grow as large as it needs to be, to accomidate the content;

    But, what if you set height OR width of a container and content inside cannot fit in?
    This is where CSS overflow property comes in, it allows you to specify how you would like handle it;
    It is useless to specify overflow property, if the height and width of box are not specified explicitly;

Syntax:
    overflow: visible, hidden, scroll, auto; // Defaults to visible;

    // Overflowed content is always rendered outside the box;
    visible - Content that extends beyond the box is visible;
    hidden - Content that extends beyond the box is hidden; Bear in mind that it makes overflowed content inaccessible;
    scroll - It gives you scrollbars both horizontally and vertically(even if they are not needed or if you need only one);
    auto - It is same as scroll, except that it shows scrollbars only when needed;
    
Can scroll bars be styled with CSS?

overflow-x
    It specifies what to do with the left/right edges of the content; 
    Eg: overflow-x: hidden; /* Hide horizontal scrollbar */

overflow-y
    It specifies what to do with the top/bottom edges of the content;
    Eg: overflow-y: scroll; /* Add vertical scrollbar */
