font-family: font-1 font-2 ... font-n generic-font-family; 
	Default value: depends on user-agent(may vary from element to element).
	Eg: font-family: "Times New Roman", serif;
	1. You can specify one or more fonts and/or a generic font family.
	   If the browser doesn't find the first font, it will try the second font and then the third and so on.
	2. Always end your font list (even if it's a list of one) with a generic font.
	   If the browser can't find any of the fonts specified, it randomly picks a font from generic family specified.
	3. If the font you want to use is more than one word or if it contains any specials chars in its name such # or $, then you should surround it with double-quote marks.
	   If you leave off the quotation marks, there is a chance that user agents will ignore that particular font name altogether, although they’ll still process the rest of the rule.
	   Generic font family names should not be put into quotes.
	   If you quote a generic name, then the user agent will assume that you are asking for a specific font with that name (for example, “serif”), not a generic family.

		Don't use more than 3-4 fonts on any one page.
		Don't change the font in mid sentence unless you have a very good reason.
		Sans serif for online, serif for print.
		Monospace for typewriter and code.
		Script and fantasy for accents.
		Fonts in each family and when to which font: http://webdesign.about.com/od/fonts/a/aa080204.htm

What are Web-Safe Fonts?
	Fonts that are likely to be available in almost all devices, browsers and Operating Systems. Eg: Arial, Courier New, Georgia, Times New Roman, Verdana;
	
font-face
	With CSS3 font-face, You are no longer forced to use web-safe fonts, you can use any font that is not installed on the user's computer.
	Example:
		@font-face {
			font-family: myFirstFont;
			src: url(sansation_light.woff);
		}
		div {
			font-family: myFirstFont;
		} 

Different Font Formats
	TrueType Fonts (TTF), OpenType Fonts (OTF), Web Open Font Format (WOFF), SVG Fonts, Embedded OpenType Fonts (EOT);
	
	
	ttf/otf, woff, svg fonts, eot fonts;
	
	1. font-family, font-size, font-weight, font-style, text-decoaration, color, text-transform, line-height, font-variant
font attributes: font-family: verdana, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 120%;
font - font-style font-variant font-weight font-size/line-height font-family
	font-style: normal | italic | oblique;
	font-variant: normal | small-caps;
	font-weight: lighter | normal | bold | bolder | 100 | 200 | 300 | 400 | 500 | 600 | 700 | 800 | 900; // 400 - normal, 700 - bold

	font-variant:
	font-stretch:
Thus, most of the document will use a serif font such as Times, including all paragraphs except those that have a class of signature, which will instead be rendered in a cursive font such as Author. Heading levels 1 through 4 will use a sans-serif font like Helvetica, while the elements code, pre, tt, and kbd will use a monospace font like Courier.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

font-style: normal | italic | oblique;
	Specifies the style of text content of an element.
	normal - default, upright text(text which is not italic);
	italic - If italic is specified and there is no italic face available, the browser will look for an oblique face before it tries to mimic the italic.
		If both italic and oblique faces are not available, browser will mimic the sloping effect.
		To prevent the browser from mimicking italic or oblique face, use the font-synthesis property (if supported).
	oblique - same as italic;
	italic vs oblique: Most browsers render oblique same as italic.
		According to the spec, "Italic faces are generally cursive in nature while oblique faces are sloped/slanted versions of the regular face."
		However, if both italic and oblique faces are not available, browser will mimic the sloping effect, in which case they look the same.

font-variant: normal | small-caps;
	It provides an effect that that is slightly different from text-transform: uppercase;
	The difference being, with small-caps, the lower-case characters results in slightly scaled down upper-case letters.
	small-caps effect is best suited for chapter titles etc; Eg: <h1 font-variant="small-caps">Chapter 1: Down The Rabbit-Hole</h1>
	
font-weight: normal/400 | bold/700 | 100 | 200 | 300 | 400 | 500 | 600 | 700 | 800 | 900 | lighter | bolder;
	Specifies the weight or boldness of text contents of an element.
	normal - To remove the bold formatting from an element that is bold by default, such as <h1> to <h6>, set the value of font-weight to normal.
	lighter, bolder - selects a font-weight that is lighter or bolder than the font-weight inherited from the parent element;
		Exact behavior varies from browser to browser: http://destination-code.blogspot.in/2009/01/font-weight-bolder-and-lighter.html

font-size: xx-small | x-small | small | medium(default) | large | x-large | xx-large | smaller| larger | <absolute-size> | <relative-size> | <percentage>;
	Smaller is roughly equivalent to 80% or 0.8em, and larger is roughly equivalent to 120% or 1.2em(of parent's font size).
	Relative sizes are relative to font-size of parent element. // 1.5em = 1.5 * parent's font-size;
	---
	Tip: When setting font sizes, your best strategy is to set a relative-length size for the <body> tag (such as 100%), and then use absolute font sizes (such as small) or relative font sizes (such as larger) to adjust the size. 
	Doing so ensures the most consistent and versatile page viewing regardless of the actual media used (computer screen, printed page, handheld, and so on.)



ToDO:
	What is web-safe font? embedded fonts? handling bidi text? i18 text? design a page in telugu? font-size-adjust, font-stretch;
	For now, just ignore the caption, icon, menu, message-box, small-caption, and status-bar values — these are called system fonts, and you will rarely see them used in real-world code.
