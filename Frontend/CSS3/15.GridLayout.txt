Grid Layout 
    It is ideal for any 2-dimensional layout;
    It replaces float layouts, it uses less code and more reliable code;
    It works very well with flex layout;


CSS Grid introduces a series of properties that allow us to create grid structures and control the placement and sizing of grid items using CSS. 
This means that we are able to use media queries to adapt our grids to different contexts. 
We can rearrange the layout of grid items independent of their source order, which allows us to shift grid items 
around to cater for these varying contexts without having to change the underlying markup.

Grid also comes with a powerful auto-placement algorithm, which makes it easier to fill up available space 
without having to do a lot of complicated calculations. 
To a certain extent, Grid even allows some flexibility on the z-axis, in that you can overlap grid items if you need to.


Grid vs Table Layout
    Grids are far more powerful than Tables:
    - Grid allows pieces of the design to be laid out independently of their document source order;
    - It even allows overlap pieces of the layout;
    -  There arepowerfully flexible methods for defining repeating patterns of gridlines, attaching elements to those grid lines, and more. 
    - You can nestgrids inside grids, or for that matter, attach tables or flexboxcontainers to a grid.
    - And much, much more.

Grid vs Flex Layout
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
New Terms

There are 2 types of elements in a Grid: 
    Grid Container  -> an element that hold all the grid items; // display: grid | inline-grid;
    Grid Items      -> all the direct children of grid container are grid items;

There are 2 types of Grid Containers:
    Block Grid      -> display: grid;
    Inline Grid     -> display: inline-grid;

There are 2 axes in every Grid:
    Row Axis        -> X Axis;
    Column Axis     -> Y Axis;

Grid Line 
    It is horizontal or vertical line in the grid container, which separates the grid container into rows, columns and cells;
    By default, each horizontal line in the grid is numbered, starting from 1;
    Also, each vertical line in the grid is numbered, starting from 1;

    You can also name the grid lines as you wish;
    You can also mix them together; // For eg, it is valid to say 'a grid item stretches from column line 3 to line steve;
    You can also give more than one name to a grid line. You can use any of them to refer to that line;

Grid Track 
    Space between 2 adjacent grid lines is called a Track; 
    It goes from one edge of the cotainer to another; It could be a horizontal OR vertical;
    
Row -> A track that is horizontal;
Column -> A track that is vertical;

Gutter
    Space between 2 Rows and Columns; Row gutter can be different from Column gutter;

Grid Cell
    It is the smallest unit of area in the grid, that is bounded by 4 grid lines, with no other grid lines running through it; // Similar to table cell;
    There is no property to associate a grid item with a grid cell directly;
    
Grid Area 
    Any rectangular area in the grid, that is bounded by 4 grid lines;
    It can be as small as a single cell OR as large as all the cells in the grid;
    CSS allows you to associate grid items to a grid area;

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
display: grid;
    It converts the container to grid and all it's children into grid items;
    By default, it will create an implicit grid(without explicit grid) with 1 column. 
    So, the following code look the same as normal flow of the document;
    Eg: 
        .container {
            display: grid;
        }
        .box {
            border: 1px solid pink;
            background-color: pink;
            padding: 2px;
        }
        <div class="container">
            <div class="box">One</div>
            <div class="box">Two</div>
        </div>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Grid can be defined either implicitly or explicitly;

Explicit Grid
    A grid is explicit, if the number of rows and columns are defined explicitly using grid-template-rows, grid-template-columns, grid-template-areas;
    
Implicit Grid    
    If there are more grid items than cells in the grid OR when a grid item is placed outside of the 
    explicit grid, the grid container automatically generates grid tracks by adding grid lines to the grid;
    These automatically added grid tracks and lines are together called Implicit Grid;

    Also, If you don't specify the number of rows and columns, display:grid creates only an implicit grid 
    (without explicit grid) with 1 column;

grid-auto-flow: row | column | row dense | column dense; // Defaults to row;
    row
        By default, this algorithm places grid items column by column, row by row, according to the order of 
        the items in the markup. When an item doesn’t fit in one row(maybe because it spans too many grid tracks),
        the algorithm moves it to the next row, looking for the space large enough to accommodate it;
        If there are no tracks suited for a grid item, it adds new row tracks implicitly;

    column -> It places the items column by column and adds new columns if needed;
    row dense -> It places the items row by row, filling any holes and adding new rows if needed; // grid-auto-flow: dense, which is equivalent to grid-auto-flow: row dense;
    column dense -> It places the items column by column, filling any holes and adding new columns if needed;

grid-auto-columns: auto | min-content | max-content | length; // Defaults to auto;
    It is used to set the width of an implicit column track;

grid-auto-rows: auto | length | min-content | max-content | minmax() | fit-content(); // Defaults to auto;
    It is used to set the height of an implicit row track;

    Eg: grid-auto-rows: 60px; 
        grid-auto-columns: 200px;
            With this, implicit tracks will have a height of 200px and width of 60px, no matter 
            if the grid item fits or not;
    Eg: grid-auto-rows: minmax(60px, auto); 
        grid-auto-columns: minmax(200px, auto);
            With this, implicit tracks are now at least 200px wide and 60px high, but
            will expand if the content demands it;

Grid Container Properties
    grid-template-rows, grid-template-columns, grid-template, grid-template-areas;
    grid-auto-flow, grid-auto-rows, grid-auto-columns; grid-row-gap, grid-column-gap, grid-gap;

grid-template-rows: none | <track-list> | <auto-track-list>;
grid-template-columns: none | <track-list> | <auto-track-list>;
    Using this, 
        - You can define the number of grid lines(both horizontally and vertically);
        - You also give custom name to each grid line;
        - You can also specify the width/height of each track;

grid-template: none | grid-template-rows / grid-template-columns | grid-template-areas; // Shorthand, defaults to none;
    Eg: grid-template: 200px / auto auto; // Creates grid with two columns and one row with a 200px height;

grid-template-areas: none | <string>+; // Defaults to none, meaning no grid areas;
    It allows us to define named rectangular grid areas in the container;

grid-column-gap: <length> | <percentage>;
grid-row-gap: <length> | <percentage>;
    It specifies the gutter size OR gap b/w two consecutive grid columns and rows, respectively;
    Gutters do not appear on the edges of the grid, which means there is no gutter before the first track and after the last track;
    
justify-items: center | start | end | stretch; // Defaults to stretch;
    Used to justify the content within grid items horizontally;

    stretch -> Fills up the width of the grid area;
    start -> Justifies content of grid items with the starting edge of the grid area along the row-axis
    center -> Justifies content of grid items in the center of the grid area along the row-axis
    end -> Justifies content of grid items with the ending edge of the grid area along the row-axis

align-items: auto | start | center | end | stretch | baseline | first baseline | last baseline; // Defaults to stretch;
    It is used to align all items on Y-Axis;
    




    Used to justify the content within grid items vertically;

    stretch -> Fills up the height of the grid area;
    start -> Aligns content of grid items with the starting edge of the grid area along the column-axis
    center -> Aligns content of grid items in the center of the grid area along the column-axis
    end -> Aligns content of grid items with the ending edge of the grid area along the column-axis


justify-content: center | start | end | space-between | space-around | space-evenly;
    Sometimes the edges of the grid do not correspond to the edges of the grid container, which could happen if the grid tracks are sized with fixed units.
    For such cases, we can justify the grid within the grid container along the row-axis, by applying the justify-content property to the grid container.

    center -> Centers the grid within the grid container along the row-axis;
    start -> Aligns the grid to be flush with the starting edge of the grid container along the row-axis
    end -> Aligns the grid to be flush with the ending edge of the grid container along the row-axis
    space-around -> Distributes the grid tracks evenly within the grid container along the row-axis such that each grid track has equal space on either side of it, with a half-size space on either end.
    space-between -> Distributes the grid tracks evenly within the grid container along the row-axis with the first grid track flush with the starting edge of the grid container, and the last grid track flush with the ending edge of the grid container.
    space-evenly -> Distributes the grid tracks evenly within the grid container along the row-axis such that the space between any 2 adjacent grid tracks are the same.

align-content: center | start | end | space-between | space-around | space-evenly
    Sometimes the edges of the grid do not correspond to the edges of the grid container, which could happen if the grid tracks are sized with fixed units. 
    For such cases, we can align the grid within the grid container along the column-axis, by applying the align-content property to the grid container. 

    center -> Centers the grid within the grid container along the column-axis
    start -> Aligns the grid to be flush with the starting edge of the grid container along the column-axis
    end -> Aligns the grid to be flush with the ending edge of the grid container along the column-axis
    space-around -> Distributes the grid tracks evenly within the grid container along the column-axis such that each grid track has equal space on either side of it, with a half-size space on either end.
    space-between -> Distributes the grid tracks evenly within the grid container along the column-axis with the first grid track flush with the starting edge of the grid container, and the last grid track flush with the ending edge of the grid container.
    space-evenly -> Distributes the grid tracks evenly within the grid container along the column-axis such that the space between any 2 adjacent grid tracks are the same.

grid 
    grid: <�grid-template�> | <�grid-template-rows�> / [ auto-flow && dense? ] <�grid-auto-columns�>? | [ auto-flow && dense? ] <�grid-auto-rows�>? / <�grid-template-columns�>
    This is a shorthand that sets all the explicit grid properties and all the implicit grid properties in a single declaration. It also resets any gutter properties set earlier in the cascade. It will impact the following 8 sub-properties:
    /* Initial values of each sub-property */
    grid-template-rows: none
    grid-template-columns: none
    grid-template-areas: none
    grid-auto-rows: auto

Grid Item Properties
    grid-row-start, grid-row-end, grid-column-start, grid-column-end, grid-row, grid-column, grid-area;

grid-row-start, grid-row-end, grid-column-start, grid-column-end, grid-row, grid-column;
    These properties are used to define the position and size of a grid item;

    grid-row-start -> specifies the row line where the grid item starts;
    grid-row-end -> specifies the row line where the grid item ends;
    grid-column-start -> specifies the column line where the grid item starts;
    grid-column-end -> specifies the column line where the grid item starts;
    
    // Shorthand Proerpties
    grid-row: grid-row-start / grid-row-end;
    grid-column: grid-column-start / grid-column-end;
    grid-area: grid-row-start / grid-column-start / grid-row-end / grid-column-end;

    grid-area can also be used to position a grid item to one of the grid areas defined using grid-template-areas;
    



    Eg:
        grid-row: 1 / 2;
        grid-row: 1 / 3;
        grid-column: 1 / span 2;
        grid-column: 1 / -1;

grid-template-rows: none | <track-list> | <auto-track-list>;
grid-template-columns: none | <track-list> | <auto-track-list>;
    track-list      -> [<line-names>? [<track-size> | <track-repeat>]]+ <line-names>? 
    auto-track-list -> [<line-names>? [<fixed-size> | <fixed-repeat>]]* <line-names>? <auto-repeat>
    track-repeat    -> repeat([<positive-integer>], [<line-names>? <track-size>]+ <line-names>?)
    fixed-repeat    -> repeat([<positive-integer>], [<line-names>? <fixed-size>]+ <line-names>?)
    auto-repeat     -> repeat([auto-fill | auto-fit], [<line-names>? <fixed-size>]+ <line-names>?)

    These properties are used specify the size of each grid track and optionally grid line names;
    Examples:
        // <track-list> values
        grid-template-rows: 100px 1fr;
        grid-template-rows: [linename] 100px;
        grid-template-rows: [linename1] 100px [linename2 linename3];
        grid-template-rows: minmax(100px, 1fr);
        grid-template-rows: fit-content(40%);
        grid-template-rows: repeat(3, 200px);
        grid-template-rows: subgrid;

        // <auto-track-list> values
        grid-template-rows: 200px repeat(auto-fill, 100px) 300px;
        grid-template-rows: minmax(100px, max-content) repeat(auto-fill, 200px) 20%;
        grid-template-rows: [linename1] 100px [linename2] repeat(auto-fit, [linename3 linename4] 300px) 100px;
        grid-template-rows: [linename1 linename2] 100px repeat(auto-fit, [linename1] 300px) [linename3];

There are 3 ways to define <track-size>:
    1. <track-breadth>
        - It can be any valid length(px, em) or percentage;
        - It can be a Fractional Unit;
        - It can be auto, min-content, max-content;
    2. minmax(<min>, <max>);
    3. fit-content(<length>);

What is none?
    It means that there is no explicit grid;
    Rows are implicitly generated and their size is determined by grid-auto-rows property;

What is auto?
    Grid items behave like block elements;
    If you don't specify their size, auto keyword adjusts the width of those items to the max width of it's content;
    Their height is determined by their content, if it is not explicitly declared;
    
    It means that the element shrinks and expands based on its content, never having a need to overflow;
    It will fill up all the remaining space available;

What is Fractional Unit?
    It takes up a share of the remaining space propotion to its flex factor;
    For eg, given a grid container of 750px width with 3 columns of 150px, 1fr and 2fr respectively.
        First column takes up 150px and the other 2 flex columns will take up the remaining 600px in the 1:2 ratio;
        So that second column takes up 200px and the third column takes up 400px;

What is min-content?
    If you set a column track that contains only text to min-content, it will become as narrow as the 
    longest run of the text that can't be line-broken within the track;
    If you set a row track to min-content, it will never overflow, it will expand to fit-in the content!

What is max-content?
    If you set a column track that contains only text to max-content, it will become as widest as the 
    longest run of the text, without any line-wrapping of the text;
    
What is minmax()?
    Using this, you can specify the minimum and maximum size of a grid track. Grid track will not grow OR shrink outside the specified range;

    minmax(<min>, <max>);
        min - It can be <length> | <percentage> | min-content | max-content | auto;
        max - It can be <length> | <percentage> | min-content | max-content | auto | <flex>;
        If min is larger than max, then max is ignored and min is used as a minimum;

    Examples:
        minmax(200px, 1fr)
        minmax(400px, 50%)
        minmax(30%, 300px)
        minmax(50%, min-content)
        minmax(min-content, 400px)

        minmax(100px, max-content)
        minmax(max-content, 200px)

        minmax(200px, auto)
        minmax(auto, 300px)
        minmax(min-content, auto)
        minmax(max-content, auto)

    grid-template-columns: minmax(200px, 400px)         -> minimum of 200px and maximum of 400px;
    grid-template-columns: minmax(200px, auto)          -> minimum of 200px and as maximum is set to auto, it will expand to fit it's content, when content is more than 200px;
    grid-template-columns: minmax(200px, 400px) 1fr          -> First track takes up minimum of 200px and maximum of 400px; Second track takes up all remaining space;
    grid-template-columns: minmax(200px, 1fr) 200px          -> minimum of 200px and as maximum is set to 1fr, it will expands to take up it's share of free space;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(3, minmax(200px, 400px))   -> 3 column tracks that are minimum of 200 pixels wide and a maximum of 400 pixels;
    grid-template-rows: repeat(2, minmax(300px, auto));      -> 2 row tracks which are at least 300 pixels tall but have a maximum set of auto so they will expand to fit their content;
    grid-template-columns: minmax(20px, auto) 1fr 1fr;
    grid-template-columns: minmax(0,1fr) minmax(0,1fr) minmax(0,1fr);


What is fit-content([<length> | <percentage>])?
    It accepts one parameter(maximum value);
    A grid column/row with this property set will still take up as little space as necessary, according to 
    its content, but no more than the specified maximum value;
    
    It is similar to using the minmax() function, with a minimum value of 0;
    One key difference is: 
        minmax() is more likely to occupy more space than it's content;
        fit-content() does not occupy more space than necessary;
        
What is repeat([<integer> | auto-fill | auto-fit], <track-list>)?
    If you want to create a number of tracks with same size, then you can use the repeat function;
    It takes 2 params: 
        First param can be a
            - a positive number -> specifies number of tracks;
            - auto-fill, auto-fit -> calculation of number of tracks is delegated to the browser;
        Second param specifies  
            - size of each track;
    Eg: grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr); // grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr;

    ---------------------
    By using auto-fill and auto-fit, we can create a responsive grid container without using media queries;

    auto-fill
        It creates as many tracks as fit into the grid container without causing the grid to overflow;
        Eg: grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, 100px);
            grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, 1fr); // creates 1 column with all available space;

    auto-fit 
        It also creates as many tracks as fit into the grid container without causing the grid to overflow;
    
    auto-fill VS auto-fit
        Only difference is, auto-fit will collapse any empty tracks(tracks whose size is 0px);
        Eg:
            grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(150px, 1fr)); // creates as many tracks of 150px size as possible and any remaining space is equally distributed;
            grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(150px, 1fr)); // creates as many tracks of 150px size as possible, any unoccupied tracks are collapsed and remaining space is equally distributed;
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There are three kinds of track sizing. These are:

Fixed
    Tracks are given a size in absolute lengths (such as px or em), or sized with %. 
    Percentage values count as fixed track sizes because they are always the same for a given grid container size.
    The tracks’ sizing does not depend on their contents.

Flexible
    Tracks are given a flex or fractional sizing via the fr unit. 
    Their sizing does not depend on their contents.

Intrinsic
    The tracks’ size is dependent on the things found within them; i.e., with min-content, max-content, fit-content(), and auto. 
    These tracks may always be the same size for a given container size and set of content, but they 
    are not regarded as fixed for layout purposes because their contents directly affect their sizing.

The process of actually determining the size of grid tracks, including what to do when track sizes 
are overconstrained or could lead to circular dependencies, is too long to go into here. 
In broad strokes, this is the process to find the track sizes:
    1. Initialize track sizes, including determining the minimum and maximum sizes for each track. 
       Resolve fixed track sizes to absolute length values. 
       Set intrinsically sized tracks’ minimum size to zero and maximum size to unlimited. 
       Flexible tracks are left flexible, with an initial minimum size of zero.
    2. Determine the size of intrinsic (e.g., auto) tracks, resolving each to an absolute length. 
       First find sizes based on the items within the track, and then gradually add space to encompass items that span multiple tracks.
    3. Maximize tracks up to their growth limit (this is determined automatically).
    4. Expand flexible (fr) tracks by adding space according to the ratio of each track’s flex factor to 
       the total of all flex factors in the grid track.
    5. Expand any auto-sized tracks by dividing the remaining free space (if any) by the number of 
       auto tracks and expanding them equally.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There is no requirement that all grid areasbe filled with an item; 
It is perfectly possible to have some or evenmost of a grid’s cells be empty of any content. 
It’s also possible tohave grid items overlap each other, either by defining overlapping gridareas or by using 
grid-line references that create overlapping situations.

Another thing to keep in mind is that you can define as many or as fewgrid lines as you wish. 
You could literally define just a set ofvertical grid lines, thus creating a bunch of columns and only one row.
Or you could go the other way, creating a bunch of row tracks and nocolumn tracks (though there would be 
one, stretching from one side ofthe grid container to the other).

The flip side to that is if you create a condition where a grid itemcan’t be placed within the column and 
row tracks you define, or if youexplicitly place a grid item outside those tracks, new grid lines andtracks 
will be automatically added to the grid to accommodate.



firefox quantum -> It has best dev tools to work with grid layout;

fr unit
    It occupies all remaining space like flex-grow; It works on row height as well;
    If there is any free space in the container, you can tell a track to occupy all of it using fr unit;
    is it possible to distribute free space equally to all tracks? Yes;

    1fr -> one fraction of available space;

By default, all grid items are laid out in the grid as per their order in the source code; You can change it;
