	border-width - length, thin, medium, thick

	border-color

CSS margin - space surrounding an element, applies to only block level elements.
	p { margin-top: 10px; margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 30px; margin-left: 40px; }

	// short-hand notation
	p { margin: 10px 20px 30px 40px; } // sequence is clockwise from the top â€” top, right, bottom, left.

        padding between an element's edges and its content. It can be applied to both block and inline elements.
is just like a margin, except it's the white space between the margin (and border) and the actual content. 
Unlike margin, which inherits the background color of whatever is around the margin, padding uses the background-color 
specified for whatever it is padding (e.g. the "content content"). 



A border can be a visual separator between the margin on the outside, and the padding on the inside. 
You can set the width, color, and style of the entire border, or you can set each of these properties individually for each side. 

  border: thickness  border-style  color
