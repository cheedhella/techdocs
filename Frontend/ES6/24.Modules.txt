What is a Module?
    Module is a JS file that by default runs in strict mode(no need to use 'use strict');
    It means everything inside the module(variables/functions/classes) is private by default and not added to global scope;

    JavaScript has had modules for long time;
    However, they are not built into the language, implemented via external libraries;
    ES6 is the first time that JavaScript has built-in Modules;

    By default, everything inside a module is local to the module, not accessible outside the module;
    If you want to access them outside the module, you can add export keyword to it;
    You can export any top-level var, let, const, function and class;
    
    Apart from exports, a module is a normal JS code; 
    Inside a module, you can access globals like Array, Object;
    Also, If your module runs in a web-browser, you can use document and XMLHttpRequest etc;

    // export Syntax
    export {v1, v2};
    export {
        v1 as newV1,
        v2 as newV2,
        v2 as newVersion2
    };

    // default export Syntax
    // There can only one default export per file; Along with default export, a module can have multiple named exports;
    export default <entity-name>

    // import Syntax
    import {x, y} from <module-name>
    import {x as x1, y as y1} from <module-name>
    import * as myCompany from <module-name>    // import all exports from specified module into an object named myCompany;
