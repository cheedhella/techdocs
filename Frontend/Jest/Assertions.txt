expect() - is a global function, provided by react test library; So, no need to impor it;
    It always takes value as input parameter and a matcher;

    toHaveLength(2) - a matcher, it looks the data passed to expect() and make sure that some property or atttribute of it matches with what we provide;

There are many matchers available to us;
Matchers from JEST 
    expect(5).toEqual(5) -> It makes sure that value is equal to another value;
    expect(['a', 'b']).toHaveLength(2) -> It makes sure that value is an array with a particular length;
    expect(['a', 'b']).toContain('a') -> It makes sure that array contains a value OR string contains another string;
    expect(fn).toThrow() -> It makes sure that the function throws an error, when called;
    expect(mock).toHaveBeenCalled() -> make sure a mock function has been called;
