/*
Generic Interfaces


Why Generics?
    
    does not need to specify a specific type;

    So far we used functions, interfaces, classes without generics; 
    While that approach is effective for ensuring type safety, it can also be limiting, especially when we want to write code that works with any type;
    This is where generics come into play;
    

    The idea behind implementing generics was to allow users to enter the type of data theyâ€™d like to pass on a function. 
    Traditionally, you can use the any type to allow all data types on your function. 
    However, when you use the any data type, you lose the benefits TypeScript provides, which is type checking.

TypeScript generics can be used in functions, classes, interfaces, and types.
