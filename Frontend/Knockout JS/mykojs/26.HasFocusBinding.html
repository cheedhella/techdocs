            It binds focusable HTML element such as textfield or button with specified property in the view model.
            The binding is 2-way. If the HTML element is focused, then corresponding view model parameter is assigned true.
            Similarly, if the view model parameter is set to false, then associated element gets de-focused.

            It is extremely useful when form elements are dynamically generated and you want to set default focus to one of them.
