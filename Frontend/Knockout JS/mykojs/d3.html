         What is Observables?
            If you declare a ViewModel property as Observable, then each time it is updated, it gets reflected in all places where it is used.
            You don't need to write any extra code for this, KO takes care of refreshing related dependencies.

            return this.firstName() + " " + this.lastName();

      /*
         The previous example is a perfect scenario of a ViewModel that might not correlate 100% to a data model. Frequently, a data model separates the first and last name into two separate fields to make editing the data easier. However, in a view, it makes more sense to concatenate them into a single field for display.
