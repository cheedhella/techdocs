What is a Link?
    As you know, a website consists of several pages; How do you go from one page to another? Answer is links of course!

    Every link has 2 parts: label and desination;
    Label
        It can be text or image or combination of many other allowed elements;
        It is something the visitor sees in a webpage or hears in a screen reader and interacts with it to reach the desination;
        Browsers typically show label text as underlined and in blue by default; It shows hand cursor, when you hover on it;
        You can customize it with CSS;
        
    Destination
        It specifies where to go when the visitor clicks on the label;
        You can create links that go to another page OR website, jump within a page, download files etc;

How to create links?
    <a> tag is used create links;
    Attributes:
        href
            href stands for hypertext reference; 
            As a general rule, use relative URLs for links to webpages on your site, and use absolute URLs for links to webpages on other sites;
            If you omit the file name from the path, it defaults to index.html;
            If you omit the entire path, it defaults to site home page;
        target
            Using this, you can specify the window name; 
            Users don't see the window name, but it helps the browser to differentiate one window or tab from another;
            If you target several links to the same name, the links will all open in that same window or tab.
            If you always want a link to open in a different window or tab, use _blank, as in target="_blank";
            If you want a link to open in an iframe, make sure it's value should matche with id of the iframe;
    Eg:
        <a href="cats.html">Cookies</a>  // Label -> Cookies, Destination -> cats.html;
        <a href="giraffe-escapes.html">
            <p>A giraffe escaped from the zoo today, and animals rejoiced worldwide.</p>
            <p>Read more</p>
        </a>
        <a href="pioneer-valley.html">
            <h1>Cookie and Woody</h1>
            <img src="img/cookiefora.jpg" width="143" height="131" alt="Cookie" />
        </a>

Creating Links to webpage in another Site
    Eg: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat" rel="external" title="Cat entry on Wikipedia">Cats</a>
    rel attribute is optional, link works the same with or without it;
    For external links, it is recommended to specify it;
    You can use that attribute to style external links differently from internal links;

Creating Links to a specific section of the webpage
    <li><a href="#question-01">Can an id have more than word?</a></li>  // When clicked, it jumps to an element with id question-01;

    <h2 id="question-01">Can an id have more than word?</h2>   // creating anchor, just give unique id;
    <p>Yes, your ids can have more than one word as long as there are no spaces. Separate each word with a dash instead.</p>
    --------------------
    Anchor can be in another page in the same site, use <a href="page.html#anchor-name"> 
    Anchor can be in another site, use <a href="http://www.site.com/directory/page.html#anchor-name"> 

    Note: If an anchor is near the bottom of the page and the content below it isn’t at least as tall as 
        the viewable area in the browser, then the anchor may not display at the top of the window, but 
        rather toward the middle.

Creating other kind of Links
    You are not limited to creating links to other webpages;
    You can create a link to any URL: RSS feeds, images, files that you want visitors to be able to download, email addresses, phone numbers, and more;
    
    I recommend you avoid linking email addresses, because spambots grab them from webpages and bombard them with spam.
    
    A smartphone that understands tel: links will ask if you want to call the number when you trigger a link. 
    Some non-phone devices, like the iPad, will ask if you’d like to add the number to one of your contacts. 
    Finally, some desktop browsers may initiate Google Voice or Skype, but others won’t know what to do with a tel: link when it’s triggered.

    Eg:
        <a href="img/blueflax.jpg">a photo</a>
        <a href="media/piano.mp3">Listen to tickling of the ivories</a> 
        <a href="myfile.zip">Download the file</a>
        <p>Send feedback to <a href="mailto:someone@somedomain.com">someone@somedomain.com</a>.</p>
        <p>Call now for free things! <a href="tel:+18001234567">1 (800) 123-4567</a></p>
    
    If you create a link to a file that a browser doesn’t know how to handle (an Excel file, for example), the browser will either try to open a helper program to view the file or try to download it to the visitor’s drive.
---------------------------------------------------------------

By default, links will appear as follow in most of the browsers:
An unvisited link is underlined and blue.
A visited link is underlined and purple.
An active link is underlined and red.
