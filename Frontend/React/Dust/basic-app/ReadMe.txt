By the end, weâ€™ll have a working React application with features like client and server-side searching, remote data fetching, and advanced state management.




Essentially, you will learn to build your own React application from scratch, with features like pagination, client-side and server-side searching, 
and advanced interactions like sorting. I hope this course captures my enthusiasm for React and JavaScript, and that it helps you get started with it.

        In the past, websites and web applications were rendered from the server. A user visits a URL in a browser and requests one HTML file and all its associated HTM
        L, CSS, and JavaScript files from a web server. After some network delay, the user sees the rendered HTML in the browser (client) and starts to interact with it. 
        Every additional page transition (meaning: visiting another URL) would initiate this chain of events again.

    You can use React Native to build mobile apps. You can even create Desktop applications using a tool like Electron, which can run on mac and windows with React.js technology.
    React also supports server rendering of its components using tools like Next.js. 


    Message is the component that accepts props (input) and returns JSX.
    JSX is a special syntax that looks like HTML, which converts React's API calls and finally renders HTML.

    It uses HTML (JSX) inside JavaScript. 


    Microsoft has created the Fluent UI component library that gives you a chance to develop your UI (resembles office).
Material-UI offers React components that implement Google's Material UI guidelines.
React-Bootstrap contains React components that make it easy to work with Bootstrap.
Also, check the Awesome React Components list on GitHub to find more React components.
There are also mature related projects/libraries that you can use with React.

If you want routing, then go for React Router. If you want to manage a more complex data system, then use Redux and MobX.
For automated testing, use Jest, which is also from Facebook.
For RESTful API calls, use GraphQL.
For the server-side rendering of React components with node, use Express.js.
