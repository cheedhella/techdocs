	    <!-- 
	    	When browser encounters a <script> tag, it stops what it is doing and begins downloading/executing the script.
	    	In other words, all scripts are downloaded/executed sequentially, one after another;
			So, If your page has many scripts to be downloaded from CDN, sometimes downloading all script may take longer, causing slowness to the user!
