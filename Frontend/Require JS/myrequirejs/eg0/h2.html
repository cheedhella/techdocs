	    	async attribute
	    		- async attribute for <script> tags was introduced in HTML 5.
	    		- It is used to tell the browser to load the script asynchronously.
	    		- Normally, it defaults to false. However, for dynamically injected scripts, it defaults to true. 
	    		- It can cause issues, if a script takes time to load, while another script which depends on it loads faster!
