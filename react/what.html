        <p class="question"><strong>What is React?</strong></p>
        <p class="answer">
            <ul>
                <li>React is a JavaScript library(by Facebook) for building user interfaces(especially Single Page Applications);</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p class="question"><strong>What is Single Page Application?</strong></p>
        <p class="answer">
            <ul>
                <li>Prior to SPA, whenever user visits the website using URL, HTML and all it's associated CSS, JS files are downloaded from server;</li>
                <li>After some network delay, user sees the rendered HTML in browser and starts to interact with it;</li>
                <li>Every additional page transition would initiate this chain of events again;</li>
                <li>Essentially, everything was done on the server side; Client just renders it;</li>
                <br>
                <li>With SPA, whenever user visits the website using URL, entire application is delivered to the client over the network;</li>
                <li>Once downloaded, it makes a separate request to server, to get page specific data and it renders the page;</li>
                <li>During every additional page transition, it only requests the server for data; Once it gets data, everything else happens on client side;</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p class="question"><strong>React vs Angular</strong></p>
        <p class="answer">
            <ul>
                <li>React Eg: Facebook, Instagram, Netflix;</li>
                <li>Angular Eg: Google Cloud Console, Microsoft Office online;</li>
                <li>Vue Eg: Alibaba, Xiaomi, GitLab;</li>
                <li>We can install different packages(like React Router DOM for routing, Redux for state management) to make it a framework;</li>
            </ul>
